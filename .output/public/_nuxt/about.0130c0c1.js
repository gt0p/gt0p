The mission was clear, to find my specialty!
My studies (BSc, MSc, Erasmus periods) in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction at Computer Science Department of University of Crete seemed to offer me an appropriate opportunity to achieve my mission. And I was close, so close; Finally, I only had to choose between Web Development and User Experience Design fields.`,`
Well, for more than 5 years (since 2016 when AngularJS was the king) I focus, utilizing the JavaScript ecosystem, on building software platforms for the web. The last 2 years I have worked both as a professional Front and Back End developer, transforming design mockups into usable pages and designing, developing and testing RESTful APIs and robust databases.`,`
As a member of a team, I seek honest and trustworthy connections. In such environments, I feel secure, efficient and funny \u30C4. I'm not a fan of life hack "Fake it until you make it" and also I'm trying to be social without having presence on most social networking platforms.
