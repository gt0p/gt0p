  "studies": "As a student, I often imagined a career that would align with my passions and allow me to showcase a talent that felt uniquely mine. This sense of purpose drove me to explore different paths, with my studies in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Creteâ€”spanning my BSc, MSc, and Erasmus experiencesâ€”serving as key milestones in that journey. And as I got closer, I realized the choice wasnâ€™t easyâ€”it came down to two areas I was deeply passionate about: Web Development and User Experience Design.",
  "workExperience": "For over 8 years, since 2016 when AngularJS was at its peak, I have immersed myself in the JavaScript ecosystem, building web software platforms. In the past 4 years, I have worked both as a Front-End and Back-End developer, transforming design mockups into functional web pages, creating, developing, and testing RESTful APIs, and integrating third-party services using various AWS tools.",
  "values": "As a collaborator, I value trust and seek work environments where meritocracy thrives. In such spaces, I am both a productive and enjoyable team member. ðŸ˜Š",
  "hobbies": "Outside of work, I enjoy attending local meetups (like DevStaff and Open Coffee Heraklion) and participating in dance communities. Also, I have a lot of fun learning and dancing Argentinian Tango and Lindy Hop."
