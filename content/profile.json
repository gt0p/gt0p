    "As a kid, I was thinking that sooner or later I would find my dream job, the direction in which I was born to shine, having a unique and enviable talent. The mission was clear: find my specialty! My studies (BSc, MSc, and Erasmus periods) in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction at the Computer Science Department of the University of Crete seemed to offer me an appropriate opportunity to achieve my mission. And I was close, so close; finally, I only had to choose between the Web Development and User Experience Design fields."
 , "workExperience" : `Well, for more than ${webDevelopmentExperienceInYears} years (since 2016 when AngularJS was king), I have focused on utilizing the JavaScript ecosystem to build software platforms for the web. The last 3 years I have worked both as a professional Front and Back-End developer, transforming design mockups into usable pages and designing, developing, and testing RESTful APIs, as well as developing third-party integrations utilizing several AWS services.`;
