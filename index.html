				<h4>Walking around on the Web Development - UX Design spectrum</span>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As a kid I was always thinking that sooner or later I will find which is my dream job, in which
				direction I'm was born
				to shine having a unique and enviable talent. The mission was clear, to find my specialty!
				My studies (BSc, MSc, Erasmus periods) on Computer Science seemed to offer me an appropriate opportunity
				to achieve my
				mission. And I was close, so close; I only had to choose between Web Development and User Experience
				Design.

				Well, I ended up enjoying both two parts of a web product's development process, and that's awesome!
				I think of myself as a Web Developer with a demonstrated background on Human Computer Interaction
				theory.

				</h4>
				I work both as Front and Back End Developer (full stack) in the production of a web application. I
				specialize in
				JavaScript and have professional experience working with VueJs, AngularJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs and
				MongoDB. I love
				applying performance optimization guidelines and watching my web apps being "light", fast and so, highly
				interactive.
				It's oddly satisfying!

				<h4>
					𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗺 𝗜?
				</h4>
				I call myself a User experience Designer who enjoy creating user journeys. My favourite, and at the same
				time the most
				challenging, phase on User-Centred Design methodology which I follow, is Testing. The interaction with
				real users
				instead of fictional personas is a real challenge. I have experience working with Invision, Figma, and
				Gravit for
				prototyping as well as Heuristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walk-through methodologies for usability
				evaluation testing.

				When I'm away from keyboard I enjoy dancing Tango and Lindy Hop, cycling around the seaside part of
				Heraklion and hiking
				in the small but outstanding Cretan canyons.
