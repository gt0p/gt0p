        `As a kid I was thinking that sooner or later I will find which is my dream job, in which direction I'm was born to shine having a unique and enviable talent. The mission was clear, to find my specialty!
My studies (BSc, MSc, Erasmus periods) in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction at Computer Science Department of University of Crete seemed to offer me an appropriate opportunity to achieve my mission. And I was close, so close; Finally, I only had to choose between Web Development and User Experience Design fields.`,
        `
Well, for more than 5 years (since 2016 when AngularJS was the king) I focus, utilizing the JavaScript ecosystem, on building software platforms for the web. The last 2 years I have worked both as a professional Front and Back End developer, transforming design mockups into usable pages and designing, developing and testing RESTful APIs and robust databases.`,
        `
As a member of a team, I seek honest and trustworthy connections. In such environments, I feel secure, efficient and funny ãƒ„. I'm not a fan of life hack "Fake it until you make it" and also I'm trying to be social without having presence on most social networking platforms.
`,
        `When I'm away from keyboard I like joining local meetups (DevStaff, Open Coffee Heraklion) as well as dance communities, learning and dancing mostly Argentinian Tango and Lindy Hop. Moreover, I love cycling around the seaside part of Heraklion and playing football with good friends in 8x8 fields weekly.`,
