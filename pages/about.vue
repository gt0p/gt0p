  `As a kid I was thinking that sooner or later I will find which is my dream job, in which direction I'm was born to shine having a unique and enviable talent. The mission was clear, to find my specialty!
My studies (BSc, MSc, Erasmus periods) in Information Systems and Human-Computer Interaction at Computer Science Department of University of Crete seemed to offer me an appropriate opportunity to achieve my mission. And I was close, so close; Finally, I only had to choose between Web Development and User Experience Design fields.`,
  `
Well, for more than ${webDevelopmentExperienceInYears} years (since 2016 when AngularJS was the king) I focus, utilizing the JavaScript ecosystem, on building software platforms for the web. The last 3 years I have worked both as a professional Front and Back End developer, transforming design mockups into usable pages and designing, developing and testing RESTful APIs as well as developing third-party intefrations utilizing several AWS services.`,
  `
As a partner, I seek trustworthy connections and I enjoy being in work environments where meritocracy prevails. In such conditions, I feel a secure, productive, and funny teammate ãƒ„.
`,
  `When I'm away from keyboard I like joining local meetups (DevStaff, Open Coffee Heraklion) as well as dance communities, learning and dancing mostly Argentinian Tango and Lindy Hop.`,
